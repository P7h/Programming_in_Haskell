# Programming in Haskell -- Exercises and notes

This repository contains my learnings, practice code snippets and solutions to exercises in the process of my learning of Haskell using "Programming in Haskell".

## Book
The book I used is Graham Hutton's [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html).<br>
My progress is indicated below [based on the original chapters of the book]

### Part I. Basic Concepts:
1. [Introduction](https://github.com/P7h/Programming_in_Haskell/tree/master/Chap%231__Introduction) 				:white_check_mark:
2. [First Steps](https://github.com/P7h/Programming_in_Haskell/tree/master/Chap%232__First_steps)					:white_check_mark:
3. [Types and classes](https://github.com/P7h/Programming_in_Haskell/tree/master/Chap%233__Types_and_classes) 			:white_check_mark:
4. [Defining Functions](https://github.com/P7h/Programming_in_Haskell/tree/master/Chap%234__Defining_functions) 			:white_check_mark:
5. [List Comprehensions](https://github.com/P7h/Programming_in_Haskell/tree/master/Chap%235__List_comprehensions)			:white_check_mark:
6. [Recursive Functions](https://github.com/P7h/Programming_in_Haskell/tree/master/Chap%236__Recursion)			:white_check_mark:
7. Higher-Order Functions :construction:
8. Declaring types and classes
9. The countdown problem

### Part II. Going Further:
10. Interactive programming
11. Unbeatable tic-tac-toe
12. Monads and more
13. Monadic parsing
14. Foldables and friends
15. Lazy evaluation
16. Reasoning about programs
17. Calculating compilers


## MOOC
I also used edX MOOC [Introduction to Functional Programming](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0) which had Erik Meijer as the instructor as the reference while reading the book since this course is loosely based on the chapters and the slides of the book.

MOOC also helped me to validate my solutions for all the exercises of the book and also some new ones in the MOOC.<br>
Just a note, MOOC dint run this year yet. I am using the archived session of the course which ran late 2015.
